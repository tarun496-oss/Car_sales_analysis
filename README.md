# Car_sales_analysis
The goal of this project is to look at two different sets of data on car sales and figure out something useful from them. By using data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) methods, we hope to combine and analyse information from these datasets to learn more about car sales trends, customer preferences, and other important factors.
